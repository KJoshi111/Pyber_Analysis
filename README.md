# Pyber_Analysis

## Overview of Challenge:
In this challenge, we used our knowledge of Python and the Pandas library, we created a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type (Urban, Rural, and Suburban). In addition to that, we utilized our knowledge of the Pandas module and the Matplotlib module to visualize the data about the total weekly fares for each city type in a multiple line graph format.

## Results:
### Differences in the Ride Sharing Data:

* Total Rides:
  - The total rides data shows us that the most rides are in urban cities, and the least amount of rides are in rural cities, with suburban cities sitting in the middle.

* Total Drivers
  - The total drivers data shows us that the most drivers are in urban cities, the least amount of drivers are in rural areas, and the drivers in suburban areas are in the middle.

* Total Fares
  - The total fares data shows us that the total fares in the urban cities are very high as compared to rural and suburban cities.

* Average Fare per Ride
  - The average fare per ride data shows us that it the average fare per ride is least expensive in urban cities and more expensive in rural cities, and that is probably because since there are less rides and drivers in rural cities, the demand is higher, boosting the price.

* Average Fare per Driver
  - The average fare per driver data shows us that the average fare per driver is lowest in urban cities, and highest in rural cities, and this is probably for the same reason listed above, under the Average Fare per Ride data analysis.

* Total Fare by City Type
  - The total fare by city type graph shows us that the total fares in the USA for urban cities is the highest, in the middle is the total fare for suburban cities, and the least amount of total fares is in rural cities:

## Summary:

In conclusion, the data shows that since urban cities are more developed, they have a higher amount of drivers and total rides, hence boosting the total cost. However, because public transport is very common in urban cities, the demand is lower, causing the average fares to go down. The rural areas are less developed and transport overall is less used, therefore the amount of drivers and total rides is comparatively lower, hence the total fares are relatively lower. However, because public transport is less common, the demand for public transport is high, causing the average fares to go up. The suburban cities stay right in between the urban and rural cities, with the total fares not too high, not too low, and the average fares not too high nor low. The same goes with the total rides and drivers, not too high, not too low.

My recommendations to you are to put discount offers in rural cities to encourage more people to use our application. For example, if you take 2 rides, one will be free. Furthermore, we can also give driver incentives to encourage more drivers in the rural cities, as there are very few drivers in rural cities as compared to urban cities. Finally, we can invest in advertising for PyBer, especially in January, because in January, the total fares for the urban cities are pretty steady, and then they boost up throughout the year. We can use the same "buy 2 get 1 free" rides offer, and this would help the urban city type, along with the two others in boosting the total fares and total number of rides. In this way, more drivers will get business, which will help the company revenue.
